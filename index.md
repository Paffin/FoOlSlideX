## Welcome to the Documentation of FoOlSlideX!
This is a small webpage with all the information you need, to set up your own Manga-reader for your Scanaltion group. This guide features:
- Screenshots of FoOlSlideX in action
- Documentation of Features & functions
- A fully detailed setup guide
- And more useless Information you'll never need
So let's get started, shall we?

## History
[FoOlSlide](https://github.com/FoolCode/FoOlSlide) was first released by [FoOlCode](github.com/FoOlCode) and is very old, so it doesn't work with technologie nowadays (PHP 7, etc) anymore. So they came up with [FoOlSlide2](https://github.com/FoolCode/FoolSlide2). However, this is now older. Then, some guy named [chocolatekey](https://github.com/chocolatkey) decided to remake it and his version can be found [here](https://github.com/chocolatkey/FoOlSlide2). However, this doesn't work anymore, too! So I decided, why not recreate the worlds most powerful Manga/Comic-reader ever created by the human race?! Well, here I am now.
