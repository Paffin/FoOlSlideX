# Important Notice
I am currently very busy with school, so I am not able to work much on this. Also, I need to rework the complete UI since it's not responsive and I want to have it responsive. I'll work on this ASAP, just can't do any promises. To support me to make development faster, consider donating: https://paypal.me/WOLFRAMEdev :)
