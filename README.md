# FoOlSlideX
The new, most powerful Comic Reader ever created by the human race.

# Requirements
PHP greater than 7.0 and everything related to MySQL.<br>
apache2 as server and htacces enabled. Nginx maybe works too, but I didnt test it.<br>
Some mangas and chapters of course.

# Do not use yet
RoriconScans is still being built. Using it may be VERY difficult. However, everything you need to know is in "core/config.php".
Once configured, login to your MySQL Database (via phpMyAdmin?) and import "roriconscans.sql".
You're ready to go (if this would work properly now). For admin acces, see the file "views/pages/users.php" and edit them to your likings (also mentioned in the config). Indexing Mangas and chapters doesnt work yet, but is going to be implemented.

# To-do
a lot of things... going to bed now, may add 2morrow.
