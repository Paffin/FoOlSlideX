        This Site is powered by <a href="https://github.com/saintly2k/FoOlSlideX" target="_blank">FoOlSlideX</a>. An Open-Source PHP software for Reading Manga online for Scanlation-groups. It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/saintly2k" target="_blank">$aintly2k</a> for learning purposes, also I wanted my own Manga CMS since MangaDex went down after some retards decided to breach the Database. Thanks, good job! In addition to that, an other Scanlation-Group (called FoOlZ or so) originally created FoOlSlide. However, they disabondoned the Project after they disbanded, then Chocolatekey came and decided to make FoOlSlide2, it was well-done, however it hasn't been updated for years now and doesn't work with newer versions of PHP anymore. So here we are now...<br>
        <br>
        The Credits for CSS belong to the MangaDex leak by HoloGFX (also not very cool) but everything else is made by me, $aintly2k.<br>

        Have fun Scanlating and reading :3
